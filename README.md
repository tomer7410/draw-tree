# Getting Started with Tree component
The Tree component takes Tree with unlimited number of children object as props and draw it in 2d. in my example the tree built as all the dividers of the root recursively. 

The method which create the Tree is " buildTree " which take a number as parameter and create tree that represent all the integer dividers of this number recursively, in this example the root is 16
